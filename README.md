# Product Builder Project

This is a Product Builder Project So that it builds products in a simplified manner. You may see that the design is simplified, but it contains many more functions than you imagine
The most important thing is that I used React and Typescript and  tailwind css and headless ui and Toaster
The project is beautiful and it is a simulation of a project to build products for e-commerce
In the future I will build a store and will inquire about this model
I listen :)
